        <h3>Indian – in
			spirit, soul and
			seasoning!</h3>
        <h4>Do not make it bland.
		Do not forget our traditional
		ingredients.
		Do not add salt.
		Make sure the grandparents like it.</h4>
        <p>These were among the many tips and
		advice we received from friends, family,
		mothers and grandmothers, while
		developing our Happibo recipes. It was
		only apt.</p>

        <p>Raising a child in India is a family festival
		of sorts. Traditional foods, numerous
		pieces of advice and over-cautious
		grandparents are part of the vibrant
		culture that the child grows up with.
		Happibo had to capture this.</p>

		<p>Our products blend in the goodness of
		our age-old traditions with traditional
		ingredients cooked in a way that is
		quintessentially Indian.</p>

					<h3>Driven by parents, <br/>led by a mother</h3>
						<p>Becoming a mother was the most beautiful day of my life!</p>

						<p>With motherhood also came the highest
						level of responsibility – my child. As a
						working mother, there were times when
						cooking healthy, wholesome meals five
						times a day proved to be difficult. Curd
						rice, roti-jam and doodh-roti started
						appearing on my son’s plate more often
						than I liked and I knew it wasn’t right.<br/><br/>
						When I looked for alternatives to my own
						cooked food, nothing tasted real or was
						chemical-free or suited my son’s Indian
						palette.<br/><br/>
						After interacting with hundreds of
						mothers, I realised I was not alone.
						Happibo is the result of people around
						the world connecting with the purpose
						of raising healthier, happier kids. We
						hope that it, in turn, helps bring more
						parents together!</p>
