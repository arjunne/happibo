		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of personal information and to handling the
		personal information in a responsible manner in accordance with the relevant privacy
		legislation in the countries of our operations (referred to as privacy legislation). This
		Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and disclose your personal information, how
		you may access that information and how you may seek the correction of any information.
		It also explains how you may make a complaint about a breach of privacy legislation.
		From time to time, we may make changes to our policy, processes and systems in relation
		to how we handle your personal information. We will update this Privacy Policy to reflect
		any changes. Those changes will be available on our website.</p>
		<h4>Collection</h4>

		for providing our core services and products. This information may include your name,
		address, phone numbers, date of birth, gender. This information may be stored on our
		computer records system and/or in printed records (collectively, information). Wherever
		practicable we will only collect information from you personally. We collect information
		in various ways, such as over the phone or in writing, in person, or over the Internet. We
		will notify you or will endeavour to make you aware that information is being or has been
		collected. We will endeavour to inform you of the purpose of collection and will provide
		you with access to our Privacy Policy that contains details about access, correction
		and complaints. We advise that if you notify us that you do not wish to provide the

		website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep
		this information confidential and the data is used only for the activities we have asked
		them to perform. We may also release your information when we believe such release
		is appropriate to comply with the law, or protect ours or third party rights, property, or
		safety. However, non-personally identifiable information including statistical data may be
		provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, research or other uses.</p>
