					<h3>Variety for a healthy eating habit</h3>
					<p>Nature has so many wonderful things
					to offer your baby, and Happibo is
					happy to help your child discover this
					amazing world!<br/><br/>
					Babies start off with a clean palette
					so what you feed them now will help
					develop their taste buds and appetite
					for the rest of their lives. Incorporating
					different fruits and vegetables in
					their diets will ensure they get a
					variety of nutrients necessary for their
					growth and development. Of course,
					some vegetables are less palatable
					than others but the earlier you start
					them, higher the possibility of your
					child liking them. One more thing –
					introducing a variety of ingredients
					early in life reduces the odds of
					developing allergies later in life.<br/><br/>
					From healthy greens like spinach
					to the nutritious sweet potato and
					colourful carrots and beets, every
					Happibo meal has something healthy,
					something yummy for your child.</p>

						<h3>Nutrition from Happi ingredients</h3>
						<p>Feeding needs to go beyond just filling your
							baby’s tummy – and Happibo meals ensure your
							baby also gets the nutrients he/she needs. It’s
							not how much but what.<br/><br/>
							Introducing, or rather, re-introducing, Happi
							ingredients! Our take on superfoods, Happi
							ingredients have the super-ability to pack a
							punch of nutrients even in small quantities. Our
							recipes incorporate at least one of the several
							Happi ingredients we work with.<br/><br/>
							And these ingredients are no strangers to you!
							Cashew nuts, almonds and raisins are integral
							to Indian food and have always played a role in
							early feeding.</p>

				<div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
					<div class="promise-right">
						<h4>One of world's best technologies</h4>
						<p>We spent almost two years to strike the right balance
						between nutrition, taste, shelf-life and, of course,
						safety. Every Happibo recipe has gone through months
						of refinement, multiple rounds of tasting sessions and
						extensive lab studies and stability tests.</p>

						<p>The most critical bit in our product’s journey is the
						sterilization process. Our research took us across the
						world and we zeroed in on one of the oldest and
						most experienced research teams that developed
						the technology behind Plum Organics, a well-known
						international baby food company</p>

						<h4>Like we said, as a mother-led company, your child’s wellbeing is our top priority.</h4>
